# Ext JS Essentials Code Project

This repository contains the accompanying source code for the Ext JS Essentials book published by Packt Publishing.
 
## Adding Framework Resources

The project does not contain the Ext JS or Siesta frameworks which can be downloaded from their respective websites and added to the project folder.

### Ext JS

Ext JS can be downloaded from the Sencha website [http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) and should be copied into the `MyWorkspace/ext` folder.
 
### Siesta

The Siesta framework can be downloaded from the Bryntum website [http://www.bryntum.com/products/siesta/](http://www.bryntum.com/products/siesta/). It should be copied into a folder named `siesta` in the root of the project.

## Launching the Application

To start using the application, first perform a build to compile all the required stylesheets and build assets. In Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the `BizDash` folder and execute the `sencha app build` command.

You can then open the app by navigating to the `index.html` file, found in the `BizDash` folder, in your browser. It is important that the app be run from a local web server so the files get served correctly.
